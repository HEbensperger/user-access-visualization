=========================
This repository contains a Force.com IDE project related to the Dreamforce '12 session entitled 
"Building Administrative Tools with Permission Set API."  Specifically, this project provides
a set of VisualForce pages and Apex classes that demonstrate one possible way of visualizing
a user's complete set of access rights, at least those access rights that are accessible via
the SObject API.
